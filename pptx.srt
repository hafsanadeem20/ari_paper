Sometimes it’s hard for an instructor to

00:00:02,025 --> 00:00:04,005
take the time to record their lectures.

00:00:04,005 --> 00:00:06,075
For example, I’m in a coffee shop and it

00:00:06,075 --> 00:00:09,000
may be loud.

00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,666
Here is an example of a plot with really

00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:14,333
small axes.  We plot the x versus the

00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:17,000
y-variables and a smoother between them.
