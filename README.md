<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of ari\_paper is to showcase the [`ari`
package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ari). We show how to use
each function and the output videos. This README uses the
[`video`](https://github.com/muschellij2/video) package to render videos
inside the markdown.

``` r
library(video)
```

``` r
video::video("noise.mp4")
```
