The goal of ari_paper is to showcase the [`ari` package](https://cran.r-project.org/package=ari).  We show how to use each function and the output videos.  This README uses the [`video`](https://github.com/muschellij2/video) package to render videos inside the markdown.

```{r}
library(video)
```

```{r}
video::video("noise.mp4")
```
